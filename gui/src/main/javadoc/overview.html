<p>A library for creating simple GUIs in introduction-level programming courses.
    The default backend uses Swing to display the GUI in a window, but the
    library does not expose any Swing types or concepts directly; instead, all
    functionality is exposed using a simple, single-threaded, and mostly
    primitive-type-based API. In addition, there is an experimental backend that
    exposes the GUI as a web page using an HTML5 canvas.
<p>The base API uses a single object of type {@link gui.Gui} and focuses on
    drawing operations and global user inputs. An extended interface allows
    adding "{@link gui.component.Component}s", which are objects that draw
    themselves on the GUI and can react to local user inputs using simple
    callbacks.
