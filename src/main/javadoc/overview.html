	<p>Classes for creating simple GUIs in introduction-level
		programming courses. The classes in this library use Swing classes
		({@link javax.swing.JFrame}, {@link javax.swing.JPanel}, etc.) but do
		not expose any Swing types or concepts directly. Instead, all
		functionality is exposed using a simple, single-threaded, and mostly
		primitive-type-based API.
	<p>The base API uses a single object of type {@link
		gui.Window} and focuses on drawing operations and global user inputs.
		An extended interface allows adding "{@link
		gui.component.Component}s", which are objects that draw themselves on
		the window and can react to local user inputs using simple callbacks.
